			<h1>Joshua Collins</h1>

			<p>Hi there! My name is Josh Collins, and I’m from Knoxville, TN. I’m a 21 year old Computer Science and Mathematics double major at the University of Alabama with a knack for database and security related field work. Outside of my passion for technology, I absolutely love music. Every year I attend the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, as well as the Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago. In keeping with that theme, it is a Sunday night tradition between my roommate and I that we spend the night listening to records and having a glass of bourbon as we prepare for the week ahead. I also have a 3 year old dog, named Katara, and she is the absolute love of my life. When not in classes, her and I are usually out having adventures at the dog park or enjoying local restaurants and venues together downtown. I believe in three core values, which are to surround myself with great people, set high goals, and work hard to succeed.</p>
