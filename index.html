			<h2>What is Krowded?</h2>
			<p>Krowded is a crowdsourced, all in one, night life concierge. This app allows users to monitor the crowdedness of local restaurants, clubs, and night life in real time, using location monitoring services. It also provides users with an ability to see various real time data such as wait times, cover charges, and specials, through user provided feedback.</p>

			<h1>Why Krowded?</h1>

				<p>When going out to a location, whether the outing is for dinner or a drink with a coworker, a person can often find themselves going to one or two locations before finally settling on a place to spend their evening. The reasons for so many changes could be anything from crowd sizes and wait times to price of entry and already in-progress events. The Krowded team believes that any individual should be able to find a location that best fits the mood of their outing before that individual ever leaves their home. This is the problem that Krowded and the Krowded team seek to solve. In a modern day society, where big data and location services abound, an individual should not have to physically arrive at a location before deciding if it is the right fit for their evening. Coupled with Google Maps API, user location tracking, and crowdsourced feedback, Krowded supplies users with real time information about outing locations, which individuals can use to better inform their decision on where to host their outing for the evening. In an effort to not only incentivise everyday individuals to use the app, but also to incentivise business owners to become involved in the community and provide feedback for their locations, Krowded allows business owners to receive hand tailored, private analytical data on their own businesses following a simple verification process.
